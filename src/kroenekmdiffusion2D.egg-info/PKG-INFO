Description: # Diffusion2D-Python-Package
        
        ## Instructions for students
        
        Please follow the instructions in [exercise_python_packaging_text.md](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material/blob/main/building-and-packaging/material/exercise_python_packaging_text.md).
        
        The code used in this exercise is based on [Chapter 7 of the book "Learning Scientific Programming with Python"](https://scipython.com/book/chapter-7-matplotlib/examples/the-two-dimensional-diffusion-equation/).
        
        ## Project description
        
        This code solves the diffusion equation in 2D over a square domain which is at a certain temperature and a circular disc at the center which is at a higher temperature. This code solves the diffusion equation using the Finite Difference Method. The thermal diffusivity and initial conditions of the system can be changed by the user. The code produces four plots at various timepoints of the simulation. The diffusion process can be clearly observed in these plots.
        
        
        ## Installing the package
        
        ### Using pip3 to install from PyPI
        
        To install via the terminal use 
        
        ``` 
        pip3 install kroenekmdiffusion2D
        ```
        
        ### Required dependencies
        
        - Python >= 3.6
        - matplotlib
        - numpy
        
        ## Running this package
         
        To start the simulation run 
        
        ```
        from kreoenekmdiffusion2d import diffusion2d
        diffusion2d.solve() # here we can use our own parameters
        ```
